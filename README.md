# 🚀 50 Days of DevOps – Learning in Public  

This repository documents my **50-day DevOps learning journey**, where I revisit, refine, and strengthen my foundations across Linux, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, AWS, Monitoring, Security, and more.  

I’ve already worked with some of these tools in real-world projects, but this journey is about **filling gaps, revisiting the basics, and practicing consistently**.
